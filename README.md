# Project Overview

This program was developed as a demonstration for a trade fair competition, where the input consists of companies from various industries, each having its own keyword. The production environment was limited to a server that supports only pure PHP, with no possibility for additional installations. As a result, the application is written in a traditional style but is fully functional except for the fact that it does not handle simultaneous server responses.

Due to time constraints of just one working day, the application is not perfect, but it serves as a proof of concept to show what can be achieved with limited resources.
